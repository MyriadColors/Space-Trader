9    Ship References
   
The ships will be listed with all their stats. The WSGC stands
for weapon slots, shield slots, gadget slots, and crew quarters.


9.1   FLEA

A Flea is cheap and tiny. It is essentially your escape pod with
a fuel tank and a cargo bay. It has ONLY 25 hull pts and 10 cargo
spaces. However, it can jump 20 parsecs, the longest of all
ships.

If you eject from a dying ship, your escape pod can be converted
into Flea for 500 credits.

Hull: 25  Cargo: 10 Jump: 20  W/S/G/C: 0 / 0 / 0 / 1

Suitable for: nothing, except getting you to a system where you
can buy another ship

Survivability: F (a kick in the shins will blow this ship up)

Pros: cheap, long-range

Cons: not likely to survive in this ship except in the quietest
sectors.


9.2   GNAT

Gnat is your starting ship. It is a suitable ship for a starting
trader, but lack of shields means it wouldn't last in anything
except for the safest systems.

Hull: 100 Cargo: 15 Jump: 14  W/S/G/C: 1 / 0 / 1 / 1

Suitable for: trading

Survivability: D (no shields!)

Pros: you start with this ship for free, and it's... bearable

Cons: no shields, low cargo


9.3   FIREFLY

Firefly is the ultimate small ship. It has an excellent jump range,
large cargo bay, and a shield slot, making it far more survivable
than the Gnat.

Hull: 100 Cargo: 20 Jump: 17  W/S/G/C: 1 / 1 / 1 / 1

Suitable for: trading

Survivability: C (single shield slot)

Pros: has some of everything, good all-around beginner's ship

Cons: expensive for a small ship, no extra quarters for mercs and
such


9.4   MOSQUITO

Mosquito is the smallest combat-oriented ship you can buy,
excellent for bounty-hunting or pirating. Its main problem is its
short legs, at only 13 parsecs.

Hull: 100 Cargo: 15 Jump: 13  W/S/G/C: 2 / 1 / 1 / 1

Suitable for: pirating / bounty-hunting

Survivability: C

Pros: 2 weapons put you ahead of other small ships (except other
Mosquitos)

Cons: low jump range, low cargo space


9.5   BUMBLEBEE

Bumblebee is a larger firefly, with slightly more cargo space,
gadget slot, shield slot, AND crew quarter, so now you can
finally, hire a mercenary.

Hull: 100 Cargo: 25 Jump: 15  W/S/G/C: 1 / 2 / 2 / 2

Suitable for: trading

Survivability: B (double shields)

Pros: survivable, lots of gadgets, room for mercenary

Cons: small cargo space for a medium-size ship


9.6   BEETLE

The Beetle is a very weak freighter, with a weak hull, and NO weapons.
It, however, has a huge cargo bay, and THREE crew quarters.
Still, it is not really survivable, and thus not recommended. If
you must use it, visit only safe systems.

Hull: 50  Cargo: 50 Jump: 14  W/S/G/C: 0 / 1 / 1 / 3

Suitable for: trading

Survivability: C- (single shield)

Pros: huge cargo bay, lots of crew

Cons: lousy hull, no weapons, lousy jump range


9.7   HORNET

Hornet is mainly meant as a shooter, with 3 weapon slots. It can
be a dangerous ship in hands of the right crew.

Hull: 150 Cargo: 20 Jump: 16  W/S/G/C: 3 / 2 / 1 / 2

Suitable for: pirating / bounty-hunting

Survivability: B (double shields)

Pros: 3 weapon slots for lots of firepower

Cons: lousy cargo room, minimal gadget space


9.8   GRASSHOPPER

Grasshopper is a more "civilized" Hornet. It gave up one weapon
for the larger cargo bay, 2 more gadget slots, and one more crew
quarter.

Hull: 150 Cargo 30  Jump: 15  W/S/G/C: 2 / 2 / 3 / 3

Suitable for: everything

Survivability: B+ (extra gadget slots)

Pros: very "average" ship, okay in everything

Cons: jack of all trades, expert at nothing


9.9   TERMITE

Termite is the largest trading ship you can get, and the only
ship with 3 shield slots! With a monstrous 60 space cargo bay,
you can buy out the entire inventory of a planet! Its only problem is
its lack of range...

Hull: 200 Cargo: 60 Jump: 13  W/S/G/C: 1 / 3 / 2 / 3

Suitable for: trading

Survivability: A+ (3 shield slots!)

Pros: HUGE cargo bay, 3 shield slots

Cons: lousy jump range, minimal weapons


9.10  WASP

Wasp is the ultimate ship, with a strong hull, 3 weapon slots, two
shield slots, 2 gadget slots, and three crew quarters, AND 35
spaces of cargo.

Hull: 200 Cargo: 35 Jump: 14  W/S/G/C: 3 / 2 / 2 / 3

Suitable for: everything

Survivability: A- (2 shield slots, but lots of room for gadgets)

Pros: 3 weapons AND 2 shield slots makes this the ultimate
attacker

Cons: extremely expensive, lousy jump range
