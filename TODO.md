# Just Notes To Self

Whenever I think of something to improve but don't need another rabit hole, it goes here.

- [ ] Make a single class to handle all the possible shortcut keys for each state.
- [ ] Combine the header and title bar rendering together
- [ ] See if the canvas fill can be done once and not every frame per gamestate
- [ ] Rendering the bank accound can be a single renderer function
- [ ] Maybe a nicer way of even spacing that doesn't rely on i = 0 loops
- [ ] Header is universal height, could be a constant for alignment use
- [ ] Import all the src.interface files at once, maybe with the init py file?
- [ ] Create a dict of pygame shortcuts in the interface init file
- [ ]
